    <div class="padded">
        <p>In this project, we added reflect and refract BSDFs which allowed us to render 
            scenes with glass and mirror objects. We also implemented a thin lense to enable 
            the depth of field effect in our scences.
        </p>
    <h2 align="middle">Part 1: Mirror and Glass Materials</h2>
        <p>Here is a sequence of six images of scene CBspheres.dae rendered with 
            <code>max_ray_depth</code> set to 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 100. The other 
            settings should are 64 samples per pixel and 4 samples per light. For 
            the first few images, we have drawn red arrows that represent ray 
            bounces and have labelled the arrows numerically in order. </p>

                <figcaption>Figure 1.a: <code>max_ray_depth</code> = 0</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Figure 1.a shows just the light source because there are no ray bounces, 
                which means only light sources will be shown.
            </p>

            </figure>
            <p>In figure 1.b, we begin to see the balls as well as the walls, however 
                the ceiling still cannot be seen. We can see the walls because it only 
                takes one bouce from the light source to the walls. We can only see the 
                light source on the balls because that is also one bounce. To see the 
                rest of the room on the balls, we would need more bounces to get from 
                the light source to the other things in the scene and then onto the balls.

            </figure>
            <p>In figure 1.c, we now can see the walls on the ball, however, we still 
                cannot see the ceiling on the balls. This is because the walls on the 
                balls only need 2 bounces: from light source to a wall and then to the 
                ball. Whereas for the ceiling to show up on the balls, we still need 
                one more bounce. Futhermore, for the glass ball in the front of the 
                scene, it is still mostly black. This is because we still need one 
                more bounce for the light refraction to show up.

            </figure>
            <p>In figure 1.d, we are now able to see the whole scence, with everything 
                being reflected onto the metal ball and refracted through the glass ball. 
                Since 3 bounces are sufficient for this scene, adding more bounces still 
                shows the same scene with the same effects, as shown below.

        <p>A thin lens camera takes in light from across
            its circular lens. If an object the lens is looking
            at is at the plane of focus, then all of the rays going
            through the lens will converge of the object at the same
            point. If an object is further or closer than this plane
            of focus than the light rays going through this lens will
            all hit different points in the scene. When these rays
            are averaged together for a single pixel it gives an average
            over an area. This creates the blurring effect of things
            that are out of focus.</p>
        <p>
            With a larger aperture, the rays that are heading for
            the same plane will be even more spread apart which
            leads to increased blurring. You can see these in
            Figures 4.e-h. As the aperture increases the background
            becomes more blurry
        </p>
        <p>
            A pinhole camera is the same as a thin lens camera
            that has an aperture size of zero. All of the rays
            for a specific pixel travel through the lens at the
            same point and therefore they don't create the blurring
            effects of light rays that are hitting the lens in different
            places.
