<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<p>Give a high-level overview of what you implemented in this project. Think about what you've built as a whole. Share your thoughts on what interesting things you've learned from completing the project.</p>

<h2 align="middle">Part 1: Masses and springs</h2>

<p>
  Bending and structural constraints both act on point masses
  in the horizontal and vertical directions, while shearing
  acts on diagonal point masses. This is why when shearing 
  is turned off we see the diagonal lines disappear and when
  only shearing is on, we see only diagonal lines.
</p>

<h2 align="middle">Part 2: Simulation via numerical integration</h2>

<p>Varying the spring constant ks, changes the taughtness
  of the cloth. With a low ks like 5, the cloth is very
  loose. It bows into a vew low arch and has many ripples.
  As the spring constant increases to 500 and then to 50,000,
  the arch shrinks until its nearly flat and the number of 
  ripples decreases. If you turn the spring constant too high 
  it gets to a point where the forces the springs are applying
  are so great that the cloth is constantly flung around and
  never settles.
</p>

<table align="center">
  <tr>
    <td align = "center">ks = 5 </td>
    <td align = "center">ks = 500 </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <img src="imgs/part2/ks-5.png" width=400>

  </td>

<p>Varying the density is like the opposite of varying
  the spring constant. Low desnities produce similar effects
  to high spring constants and high densities produce similar
  effects to low spring constants. This is because acceleration
  can be described by this equation: \(a = \frac{F}{m}\).
  We can replace Force with Hooke's law giving: 
  \( a = \frac{k(l -x)}{m} \). We can see that the acceleration
  of each point mass in the cloth is proportional to the spring
  constant and inversely proportional to its mass. This is why
  density and the spring constant have inverse effects.

<p>Verying the damping has very different effects than
  the two parameters above. Damping seems to effect mostly
  the speed at which the cloth moves. Low damping allows
  the cloth to swing down rapidly and then continue oscillating
  for a while. At the extreme where the damping is 0 the cloth 
  oscillates forever, never coming to rest. With high damping
  the cloth falls down slowly as if it were going through water.

  Comparing Figure 1.a, the sphere is using the default <code>ks = 5000</code>, and 
  Figure 1.b, where <code>ks = 500</code>, Figure 1.b looks more droopy and Figure 
  1.a has larger folds. Figure 1.c, where <code>ks = 50000</code>, has even larger 
  folds than 1.a and the cloth doesn't follow the sphere's shape as well as the cloth 
  in Figure 1.a.

<p>
  As seen above, a higher density causes the cloth to fold into itself with 
  sharper creases. Similarly, lowering the ks also causes the cloth to fold 
  into iteself with sharper creases.
</p>


<h2 align="middle">Part 5: Shaders</h2>

<p>
  Shaders are used to parallize graphics computations 
  through the GPU. With openGL, .vert files calculate the
  screen space position of a vertex as well as other things
  that could be useful like the object space position. If any
  alterions to the geometry are needed they are done there. 
  Then the .frag file is used to calculate the color of pixels
  after rasterization. It can use things that were calculated
  by the .vert. Since both of these files act on very small 
  isolated elements of the image, it can be easily parallelized
  on the GPU.
</p>

<p>
  Many of the shaders we implemented in this section, made
  use of Blinn-Phong shading. It can be described with the
  following equation
  \[
    L = k_aI_a 
    \ + \ k_d\left(\frac{I}{r^2}\right)\textrm{max}(0,n\cdot l)
    \ + \ k_s\left(\frac{I}{r^2}\right)\textrm{max}(0,n\cdot h)^p
  \]
  This equation has a lot of components but it can be thought 
  of as just suming together light from three different
  sources. The left most component is the ambient light. 
  All fragments will receive this ambient light equally.
  The middle is the diffuse term. This accounts for light
  that is dispersed when it hits the object. It depends on 
  \(n \cdot l\) where \(l\) is the direction of the incoming light
  ray and \(n\) is the normal. This is term is maximized
  when the incoming light is parallel to the normal. In other
  words, when the light is orthogonal to the surface. The 
  right-most term is the specular component. This accounts
  for light that reflects off the surface like a mirror. 
  Specular light reflects incoming rays about the surface
  normal, so that the surface normal bisects the incoming
  and outgoing rays. This is way there is an \(n \cdot h\)
  term. \(h\) is the bisector of the incoming and outgoing
  rays, therefore the specular light is maximized when the 
  incoming and outgoing light rays are bisected by the normal.
  The exponent \(p\) is used to sharpen the specular
  reflection. Since \(n \cdot h \leq 1 \), the higher the 
  power \(p\) the smaller it the specular component will be.
  Only reflections that are very close to perfectly specular
  will retain any power.

<p>
  As seen above, while you can see the texture on both the sphere using 
  either bump or displacement mapping, the latter shows the actual shape 
  on the cloth, too. You can most notice this effect in by comparing the 
  cloth's crease in Figure 5.b and 5.c. In bump mapping, we are mapping 
  the texture onto the objects in such a way that forms an illusion of 
  detail, while in displacement mapping, we map the actual height of the 
  detail.

<p>
  Comparing Figures 5.d and 5.e to Figures 5.f and 5.g respectively, we see that 
  chaning the sphere mesh's coarness from 16 to 128 causes the texture of the 
  cloth look more stretched out around the sphere.
